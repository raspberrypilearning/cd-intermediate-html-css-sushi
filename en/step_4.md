## All the colours!

As you have seen, you can type in many different colour names as words and the browser will recognise them. But a more common way to set colours is to use something called a **HEX** code (HEX is short for **hexadecimal**, a special way of counting).

+ Take a look at your **stylesheet**. That's the file that has `.css` in the name.

+ Inside the CSS rules for **body**, set the background colour to

```html
  background-color: #7B68EE;
```

Note: If you are using a Mac, the `#` is typed by holding the `alt` key and the number `3` key together.

Your website should now have a purple background.

+ Not a fan of purple? Go to [dojo.soy/html2-colors](http://dojo.soy/html2-colors){:target="_blank"} and choose another colour for your stylesheet. But instead of typing the name of the colour, type in the **HEX** code.

Colour codes allow you to mix any colour, even if it's not on any list of colours. 

+ Try making up your own colour code. It must start with a `#`. This tells the browser that it is a HEX code instead of a colour name. The rest of the code is made up of six characters. They can be  any number from **0-9** and any letter from **A-F**.

Every colour is made by mixing different amounts of **Red**, **Green**, and **Blue**. You will sometimes see this written down as **RGB**. Each of these colours is represented by two of the six digits in your HEX code. `00` is none and `FF` is the maximum.

**Hexadecimal** is a way of counting that makes numbers shorter to write by using the letters A-F as extra digits. The number `255` is written as `FF` in hexadecimal. 

You don't need to worry too much about learning to count with Hexadecimal numbers. Instead, experiment with different colour codes to get used to using them.

* Here are some basic colours to try out on your website. Try putting in smaller numbers instead of `FF` to see how the shades change.

|   |R |G |B  | Result     |
|---|--|--|---|:----------:|
| \#|FF|00|00 | Red        |
| \#|00|FF|00 | Green      |
| \#|00|00|FF | Blue       |
| \#|FF|FF|00 | Yellow     |
| \#|FF|00|FF | Magenta    |
| \#|00|FF|FF | Cyan       |
| \#|FF|8c|00 | DarkOrange |

Mixing the perfect colour can take a lot of experimenting. Luckily, there are plenty of colour picking tools that help you get the HEX code for any colour you want.
